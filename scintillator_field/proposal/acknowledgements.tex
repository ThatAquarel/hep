We would like to sincerely thank Dr. Manuel Toharia for his dedication to the High Energy Particle Physics group at Dawson, for his captivating lectures and for his guidance throughout our project. We are incredibly grateful to McGill University Professor Dr. François Corriveau for his guidance as well as McGill Professor Dr. David Hanna for his invaluable advice and for graciously letting us use his scintillator block. We express our sincere appreciation to Université de Montréal technician Dr. Nikolai Starinsky for his scintillator cutting advice. This project would not have been possible without the Dawson Foundation’s Student Academic Growth and Enrichment Fund, who’s grant provided money with which we bought power tools, safety equipment, and electronics. Finally, we would like to express our gratitude to Dawson College for offering us a wonderful learning environment that allowed us to flourish and engage in science activities that we are passionate about.
