[Overview of the theory] \\ 

While we have developed the detector’s software and hardware components, precise calibration would require exposure to a controlled muon beam. Access to CERN’s world class facilities would allow us to validate our detector’s performance and refine its accuracy. It would also provide invaluable insights into innovative techniques that would contribute to the broader field of particle detection technology. We hope to collaborate with peers and experts at CERN to deepen our comprehension of physics concepts through real-world applications. We are also committed to inspiring other young Canadian scientists by sharing our experiences and findings through outreach activities. An opportunity to conduct our experiment at CERN would be a pivotal step in this journey. \\
