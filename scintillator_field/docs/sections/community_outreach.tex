Women, though largely unrecognized, have played a great role in the development of modern science. Marie Curie, Ada Lovelace, Katherine Johnson, and many others have been role models for generations of scientists. Our team at Dawson TECHNICOLOR firmly believes that part of promoting science education is promoting the inclusion of women and other marginalized groups. As such, we are currently working with Dawson STEMM FEM, a local club, to create talks and participate in events that will hopefully encourage many young women to join the beautiful field of physics and of science as a whole.

Furthermore, The Scintillating Chamber is set to be presented in May at Dawsonâ€™s ScienceFest. This event consists of a fair where a myriad of scientific projects are introduced to the student body. This opportunity will allow us to make particle physics more accessible and easier to grasp while sharing our unwavering passion.
