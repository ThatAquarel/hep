At any given moment, there are muons raining down on us at a rate of approximately 1 muon per square centimeter per minute \cite{Spectrum of CRM,hyperphysics,atmospheric muon,pdg}. 
Traditionally, spark chambers or wire chambers allow the tracking of muon trajectories. However, building a high voltage chamber is a technical challenge, especially for high school students and for their mentors worrying about safety. We wanted to create a simple, safe and easily reproducible way of observing muons, which is what led us to develop our three-dimensional scintillator-based detector, a.k.a. The Scintillating Chamber.
