## About us

![Icons](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=python,htmx,gtk,latex)


**The Dawson High Energy Physics** club, run by Dr. Manuel Toharia Zapata is a place for curious college students to learn more about particle physics. Every week, students from a wide variety of programs meet to learn and discuss about flavour physisc, extra dimensions and much more. We engage with both theory and experiments, learning about and observing particles. Our many projects include an Alpha particle detector, spark chamber, Scintillating Chamber, and more.

Here's a [video](https://youtu.be/Yp-H1ZBjPuM) about our group!


### [Alpha particle detector](./alpha_particle/README.md)

![Alpha particle detector](./alpha_particle/docs/pcb.jpg)

A solid-state alpha particle detector based off of [CERN'S DIY Alpha Particle Detector](https://github.com/ozel/DIY_particle_detector) design.

### [Higgs data analysis](./higgs_data_analysis/README.md)

Analyzing data from a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the mass of a hidden particle. This program is capable of finding a deviation from the noise and identify the mass of the unexpected particle.


### [Scintillating Chamber](./scintillator_field/README.md)

![Scintillating chamber](./scintillator_field//docs/figures/big%20detector.jpg)

Our proposal to the 2025 [Beamline for schools](https://beamlineforschools.cern/) competition. It consists of an arrangement of scitillator rods to detect and model the trajectory of cosmic ray in three dimensions. The possible trajectories are then calculated and displayed graphically to the user.
